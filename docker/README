Docker images for SUSI.AI Server
================================

Pre-built docker images for the SUSI.AI server are available on docker hub (TODO).


Building
--------
One can build local docker image by calling
	docker build -t local-susiserver --build-arg default_branch=master  .
This clones the server from the git repository [1] and builds the server.
The default branch to be build can be set via the `default_branch` argument
and defaults to `master`.

Running
-------
The SUSI.AI server needs the skill data [2] available in the docker image
mounted to
	/susi_skill_data
If you want to have persistent server data, the docker image directory
	/susi_server/data
needs to be mounted.

The server runs on the default ports, that is 4000 and 4443 which are exposed
to docker. Exporting them to the host system works the usual way using the -p
options.

A typical start script would be
	SKILLDIR=/path/to/your/checkout/of/susi_skill_data
	DATADIR=/path/to/your/server/data
	docker run  -d -p4000:4000 -p4443:4443	\
		-v$SKILLDIR:/susi_skill_data	\
		-v$DATADIR:/susi_server/data	\
		local-susiserver

Notes on configuration
----------------------
The docker image uses the default configuration as taken from the `conf`
directory with the following two changes:
- `upgradeInterval` is set to a very large number
- `skill_repo.enable` is set to false
  this disables the git pull/push updates of the skill data directory

If a different configuration is required it is enough to provide an alternative
`conf` directory and mount it to `/susi_server/conf` using the `-v` option
(see above).
